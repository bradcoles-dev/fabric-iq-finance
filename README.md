# fabric-iq-finance

A public reference implementation applying **Microsoft Fabric IQ** — Ontology, Semantic Model integration, Plan, Graph, Data agent, and Operations agent — to real-money portfolio construction over the S&P 100 + ASX 200 universe.

> **Note:** This is the intelligence layer. The underlying bronze/silver/gold data platform lives in a separate repository, [`dbt-fabric-finance`](https://github.com/bradcoles-dev/dbt-fabric-finance), which this project consumes read-only via a OneLake shortcut — no data is duplicated.

This repository is **code only**. The Fabric IQ items themselves (Ontology, Data agent, Operations agent, Plan) are built by hand in the Fabric portal rather than generated from code, and the accompanying 8-part article series, e-book, and YouTube walkthrough are written independently — neither is part of this repo.

Ontology → Data agent / Operations agent / Plan
```

Fabric data agents are read-only NL2SQL/DAX/KQL query generators — they cannot execute custom code. So the actual quant work (sector-relative value scoring, correlation-graph diversification metrics, mean-variance optimization, discrete share allocation) runs ahead of time in the notebooks below and lands in output Delta tables. Those tables are what the hand-built Ontology, Data agent, Operations agent, and Plan items point at and reason over.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Microsoft Fabric workspace with an F-SKU capacity attached, git-integrated with this repo

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bradcoles-dev/fabric-iq-finance.git
cd fabric-iq-finance
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the test suite

```bash
pytest
ruff check src/ tests/
```

The screening, diversification, optimization, and allocation logic is fully testable offline against synthetic fixtures shaped like the real gold schema — no live Fabric connection required.

### 3. Run the notebooks in Fabric

Each notebook reads the previous one's output, so they must run in this order:

1. **`NB_value_screen`** — reads `gold.dim_security` + `gold.fact_security_snapshot` → writes `iq_value_screen`
2. **`NB_diversification_graph`** — reads `iq_value_screen` + `gold.fact_return_covariance` → writes `iq_diversification_metrics`, `iq_correlation_edges`
3. **`NB_portfolio_optimizer`** — reads `iq_value_screen` + `gold.fact_return_covariance` → writes `iq_portfolio_recommendation`
4. **`NB_portfolio_actuals_refresh`** — run later, only once a position is actually purchased. Reads `iq_portfolio_recommendation`, appends to `iq_portfolio_actuals` on a daily schedule to build up the 6-month retrospective track record.

Each notebook expects the workspace's `VL_Variables` **Variable Library** with `WORKSPACE_ID` and `LAKEHOUSE_ID` keys (same pattern `dbt-fabric-finance` uses), and installs `portfolio_iq` at runtime with `%pip install git+https://github.com/bradcoles-dev/fabric-iq-finance.git`.

### 4. Build the Fabric IQ layer

Ontology, Data agent, Operations agent, and Plan are built directly in the Fabric portal against the `iq_*` tables above and Project 1's `SM_dbt-fabric-finance` semantic model — intentionally not automated here.

## Contributing

- Python is linted with Ruff (`ruff check src/ tests/`).
- All logic in `src/portfolio_iq/` must have unit test coverage using synthetic fixtures — no test should require a live Fabric connection.
- Notebooks are thin orchestration only: read data, call `portfolio_iq`, write output. No business logic lives in notebook cells.
- Fabric item folders follow `dbt-fabric-finance`'s `<PREFIX>_<name>.<ItemType>` convention (`NB_`, ...).
